_bayesbox_ is a sample software design and implementation as C++ class library for Bayesian inference.

## Features ##
  * Interface classes for some learner models
    * Normal mixture model (to appear)
    * Neural Network model (to appear)
  * Implementation of Parallel Tempering method of MCMC
  * Implementation of calculating generalization errors and learning errors

## Implementation Concept ##
  * All implementation are inline in header files for easy use

## Requirements ##
  * Boost C++ libraries (for boost::numeric::ublas, boost::random)
